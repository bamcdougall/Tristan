## Tools from AP Calculus

### Total Derivative
#### Stochastic Processes
##### Stochastic processes are observations whose value is random with respect to time

* Ito's Lemma


### Definition of e
#### Applications
* Future Value of Money
* Discount Rate

---
## Tools from Probability

### Binomial Distribution
1. $E[X] = n p$
2. $Var(X) = n p(1 - p)$

---
## Risk Neutral Valuation

### Assumptions
1. The expected return on a stock (or any other investment) is the risk-free rate.
2. The discount rate used for the expected payoff on an option (or any other instrument) is the risk-free rate.

### Purpose
1. Risk Neutral Valuation (RNV) simplifies pricing.

All returns and discounts are at risk-free rate.

2. Relationship between stock and derivative is the same regardless of risk.

Risk incorporated into price of stock.

## Risk Free Portfolio (RFP)

### Value of portfolio is same whether stock price goes up or down:

\begin{equation}
    (\Delta S_o) u - f_u = (\Delta S_o) d - f_d
\end{equation}

### $\Delta$ Hedge
### Determine number of shares required for RFP

\begin{equation}
    \Delta = \frac{f_u - f_d}{S_o (u-d)}
\end{equation}

## Stochastic Processes

### Stochastic processes are observations whose value is random with respect to time.

---

### Markov Process
* Markov process with respect to stock price implies that future price only depends on current price.
* Distribution is normal

Means are additive and variances are additive

---

#### Wiener Process
* Distribution is standard normal, i.e. mean = 0 and variance = 1.

A physical example of a Wiener processes is Brownian motion.

$Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$

* Two properties are:
1.  The change $\Delta z$ during a small period of time $\Delta t$ is $\Delta z = \epsilon \sqrt(\Delta t)$ where $\epsilon$ is a standard normal distribution $\Phi(0,1)$.
2.  The values of $\Delta z$ for any two different short intervals of time, $\Delta t$, are independent.
